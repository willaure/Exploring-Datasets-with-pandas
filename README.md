# Introduction

The aim of this lab is to provide you a refresher on the Pandas library, so that you can pre-process and anlyse the datasets before applying data visualization techniques on it. This lab will work as acrash course on pandas. if you are interested in learning more about the pandas library, detailed description and explanation of how to use it and how to clean, munge, and process data stored in a pandas dataframe are provided in other IBM courses.

Exploring Datasets with pandas 
pandas is an essential data analysis toolkit for Python. From their website:

pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

The course heavily relies on pandas for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. We encourage you to spend some time and familiarize yourself with the pandas API Reference: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html.

# The Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 

Dataset Source: International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision.

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international immigrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. The current version presents data pertaining to 45 countries.

In this lab, we will focus on the Canadian immigration data.
